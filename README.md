# CNN Image Classification Model

This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class image classification.

## Features

- Implements a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
- Uses data augmentation techniques for improved model generalization
- Employs early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal training
- Designed for classifying images into 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street

## Usage

1. Ensure you have TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and scikit-learn installed
2. Prepare your image dataset in the specified directory structure
3. Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed
4. Run the script to train the model on your image data

This project is ideal for researchers and developers working on image classification tasks, particularly in environmental or geographical contexts.
